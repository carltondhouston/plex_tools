# Plex Tools

This repo has stuff I have created/vibed out my AI mouth for managing and working with Plex.

This repo includes the following tools:

* `migrate_playlists/migrate_plex.py` connects to a source and a destination plex server and allows you to migrate playlists, collections, artwork, and metadata.
* `migrate_access/sync_plex_shares_by_library_name.py` uses your Plex account or a server API token to copy access for matching libraries from a source to a destination server.
* `library_tools/find_sd_in_plex_library.py` finds low quality media in a given library.  Can return a list of absolute paths, which is handy for batch deletes and whatnot.
